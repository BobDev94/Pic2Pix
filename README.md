# Pic2Pix
A script to process pictures/drawings of people to turn them into sprites usable in 2d game engines like GameMaker

A basic demo of what you can expect this script to do:

                   |
                   V

![Sprited](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d283df28-e98f-4853-8a27-423b38e56d84)

The background doesnt have to be a perfect green screen. so long as it is distinct from the target, and is somewhat uniformly colored, it will be filtered out.

Try turning yourself into a sprite!

The default color palette in the code is fantasy24 on Lospec

For pencil drawings and doodles, anything with just a single color, RENAME YOUR IMAGE SO IT HAS "PENCIL" in the name

Yes, I have the artistic ability of a drunk walrus. Hopefully, you're much better.
